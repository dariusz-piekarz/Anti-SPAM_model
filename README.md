# SPAM classifier model
The aim of this exercise is to train model which will classify emails to SPAM and HAM. We will use sample emails available here: *https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/*. Emails there as classified to `spam` and `ham` and compressed to `tar.bz` format.
All details of processing data and model selection can be found in the `.ipynb` file. 
## Remarks
This is my first ML project, and I test several models to the classification problem (some of them are more or less irrelevant).
